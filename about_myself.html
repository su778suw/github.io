     I love mountains and forests. Ever since i was born we went once or twice a year to spain to visit the family of my fathers side. They live all acros the world but we all come from 1 place. The cantabrian mountains.
     There are a lot of high mountains and old trees with one of the most diverse wildlife of europ.
     Almost all the people that live in that area are some kind of distance family and we all know eatchother.
     i might want to work there later if i have finished my studies.

I also love travel wich i share with my mothers side of the family. My mother takes me every 2 or 3 years on a big traveling vacation where we first move 2 weeks trough the country and see how it looks and works and the for last week we chill on a nice beach or island to rest and calm down before the real world at home begins.
the vacations i love the most are .
1. Kenia with my mother and uncle that worked 16 years as ranger in africa.
2. thailand with only my mother.
those where some expiriences that i will never forget.
