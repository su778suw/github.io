    <h1>Color Models: RGB and CMYK</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>RGB Color Model</h2>
        <p>The RGB color model stands for "Red, Green, Blue." In this model, colors are created by combining different amounts of red, green, and blue. By adjusting the intensity of these colors in each pixel of an image, we can achieve a wide range of colors. A pixel is the smallest point in a digital image. The resolution of an image is determined by the number of pixels per inch (PPI) or pixels per centimeter (PPC).</p>

        <h2>CMYK Color Model</h2>
        <p>The CMYK color model stands for "Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black)." This model is often used in printing, such as magazines, brochures, and posters. In the CMYK model, colors are created by mixing these four ink colors. The main difference from RGB is that the RGB model uses light to create colors, while CMYK uses ink. This can lead to color variations between screen display and printed materials.</p>

        <h2>Pixels and Resolution</h2>
        <p>A pixel is the smallest discernible element in a digital image. The resolution of an image or screen is measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or pixels per centimeter (PPC). The higher the resolution, the more pixels there are in a given space, and the sharper and more detailed the image will be. Resolution is important for printing images (e.g., for CMYK printing) and displaying images on screens (e.g., on computers or mobile devices).</p>
