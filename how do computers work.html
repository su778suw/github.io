<h2>A computer operates in four steps:</h2>
<p><h3>Input</h3></p>
  <h4> Input is the initial stage where a computer receives data and commands from external sources.<p> This can take various forms, including text entered through a keyboard, mouse movements and clicks, touch gestures on a touchscreen, or data from sensors like microphones and cameras.</p> These input data are typically transformed into a format that the computer can understand, usually in binary code (combinations of zeros and ones).
  </h4>

<p></p> <h4>
    Once the computer has received input, it enters the processing stage. This is where the received data is analyzed and manipulated.<p> <h4>The central processing unit (CPU) of the computer plays a crucial role at this stage. It performs tasks such as mathematical computations, data comparisons, logical decision-making, and executing instructions based on the received data.<p><h4> The results of these operations are often temporarily stored in the computer's memory.</p>
</h4>
<p></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<h4>After processing, the computer generates output to convey information or perform actions. <p></p>Output can take various forms, including displaying text and graphics on a monitor, playing sound through speakers, driving motors and other physical devices, printing documents on a printer, and more. The output data often originate from the results of the processing stage.</h4>

<p></p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<h4>Computers store data for future use in storage devices like hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), USB drives, and cloud storage. <p></p><h4>This is essential because it allows the computer to retain data even when it's powered off. Storage devices hold programs, files, images, videos, and other data that can be accessed, processed, and displayed by the computer later on.</h4>
